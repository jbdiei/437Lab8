            <p>Here are some of my hobbies!</p>

                <p>Over the summers in my hometown I love to wakesurf! 
                I haven't been doing it for very long, but I am getting progressively 
                better and better. Since I do not own a boat, I always go with friends
                which makes it really enjoyable and always a great time. Even if I am 
                not actively wakesurfing, being on the boat in the lake during the summer
                is a really great vibe.</p>

                <p>I have been playing soccer for as long as I can remember. I love 
                playing competitively, but at college I just play for fun with friends.
                It brings me so much joy being on the field, and even as much joy
                just watching the beautiful sport.</p>

                <img src="sunsets.JPG" alt="Beautiful beach sunset" width="500" height="500">
                <p>Another hobby that I have picked up while at SLO is going to the 
                beaches and watching sunsets. It is very relaxing and going with friends
                makes it even better. Very soothing hobby.</p>
